## 📝 Privacy Notice

**Secuditor Free** is a diagnostic security tool that runs locally on your device.  
It does **not collect, store, or transmit any personal data** or system information without the user’s explicit action or consent.

All analyses and reports are generated and stored locally in the same folder where the software resides.  
No personal information is sent automatically.

The application may optionally connect to our secure servers to:
- Check for software updates  
- Synchronize online security resources (e.g., threat intelligence or malware lists)

These connections transmit only **non-personal, technical data** (e.g., version identifiers or checksum values).

Optional online checks (like public IP lookups or external connection analysis) are performed **only when initiated by the user**.  
All logs and cache generated by the software are stored locally on your device (e.g., in *Documents* or *Cache* folders).
